## Known issues
- The banner image does not align properly once the analysis is complete - primarily due to the fact that I've used margin attribute in CSS in absolute pixels instead of it being relative. \
- The colors of each Pokemon Type is not being displayed correctly, but rather all are displayed as white as of now.\
- Since this is a vanity project, I want it to run side by side with a local LLM, and as such, I'm trying to learn how to integrate it with Ollama
